## Spark DataFrame Basics

Spark DataFrames are the workhouse and main way of working with Spark and Python post Spark 2.0. DataFrames act as powerful versions of tables, with rows and columns, easily handling large datasets. The shift to DataFrames provides many advantages:
* A much simpler syntax
* Ability to use SQL directly in the dataframe
* Operations are automatically distributed across RDDs
